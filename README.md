# Sudoku Solver
This is a solver for Sudoku that is writted using the Python and AMPL programming languages. AMPL was used to model the problem using optimization techniques as well as solve it using the Gurobi Optimization Solver. Python was used to create the UI and write the inputted data from the user into the AMPL model as well as retrieve it once the model solved the problem. In order to use the solver you can run the sudoku.exe file from the dist/sudoku folder or open the cmd from the root and run python sudoku.py. Once the solver is open you can add the numbers from the puzzle you are trying to solve which will be typed in red. Once all of them are typed out you can press solve which will fill in the blanks with the answer which will be in black font. You can also clear the board with the clear button if you wish to solve another puzzle or made a mistake in typing out the one you need to solve.
